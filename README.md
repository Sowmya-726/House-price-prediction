House-price-prediction
This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a reliable regression model that can help buyers, sellers, and real estate companies estimate property values accurately.
🏠 House Price Prediction (Random Forest)
This project predicts house prices using a Random Forest Regressor trained on housing data (e.g., bedrooms, bathrooms, area, locality, etc.).

🔍 Key Steps
Cleaned and preprocessed data (handled missing values, encoded categories)
Performed EDA to understand trends and correlations
Trained a Random Forest model
Evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and R² Score

📈 Results
R² Score: ~0.92
MAE: ~1600
RMSE: ~2600

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
Flask for model deployment
